# Reviewing Application Forms

## Step 1: Open the Form
- Access the submitted application form from the system.
- Check that all required fields are filled.

## Step 2: Extract Key Fields
- **Name:** Ensure correct formatting (First Last).
- **Email:** Validate format (e.g., name@example.com).
- **Application Type:** Identify based on provided options.
- **Phone Number:** Ensure correct format `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`.

## Step 3: Categorize the Application
- **Standard:** If all required fields are correctly filled.
- **Incomplete:** If fields are missing.
- **Requires Review:** If the application contains unclear or special cases.

## New Section: Common Issues
1. **Missing Email:** If the email is blank, flag the application as "Incomplete."
2. **Incorrect Name Format:** If a name is written in all lowercase, suggest proper formatting.
3. **Unrecognized Application Type:** If an applicant selects "Other," escalate for review.
